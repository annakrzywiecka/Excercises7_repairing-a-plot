## Aim

My aim is to repair this plot:

![badplot](images/plot_to_be_repaired.png){fig-align="center"}

## Code

At first I load the csv file that I created myself. I assumed that the sum of numbers (not the percentage value) in each group of voters equals the (100% - percentage_value). Then I used proportion to count a number of votes in each category. Afterwards I created a data frame out of the csv data.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Table_votes_wide<-readr::read_csv("votes")

Table_votes_wide[1,2] <- round((Table_votes_wide[2,3]+Table_votes_wide[2,4]+Table_votes_wide[2,5])/0.71)
Table_votes_wide[1,3] <-round((Table_votes_wide[2,3]+Table_votes_wide[2,4]+Table_votes_wide[2,5])/0.36)
Table_votes_wide[1,4] <- round((Table_votes_wide[2,3]+Table_votes_wide[2,4]+Table_votes_wide[2,5])/0.96)
Table_votes_wide[1,5] <- round((Table_votes_wide[2,3]+Table_votes_wide[2,4]+Table_votes_wide[2,5])/0.84)
Table_votes_wide <- data.frame(Table_votes_wide)

Table_votes_wide
```

Then I wanted to create a v of a longer format so I used the `pivot_longer(data=Table_votes_wide)`.Next step was to make a column out of the headings of rows. Their values are now in a column 'number' and their names are in a column 'Voters_Group' and this column is redundant (which is a normal thing for a longer data format).

```{r}
Table_votes_long<-pivot_longer(data=Table_votes_wide, 
                             cols=colnames(Table_votes_wide)[-1],
                             values_to = "number",
                             names_to = "Voters_Group")
Table_votes_long
```

Subsequently I counted the percentages and put them into a new column. I also wanted to change the name of one of the Voters_Group categories. I needed it to be have spaces for the plotting to look good for the reader.

```{r}
Table_votes_long <- Table_votes_long %>%
  group_by(Voters_Group) %>%
  mutate(sumnum = sum(number)) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(number/sumnum,2)*100)
  
Table_votes_long <- Table_votes_long %>%
  mutate(Voters_Group = ifelse(Voters_Group == 'Allregisteredvoters', 'All registered voters', Voters_Group))
  
Table_votes_long
```

And finally I create a plot.

-   It has Voters_Group on the x axis and percentages of the votes on the y axis. I fill them by the voters choice.

-   It is a bar plot which doesn't show counts of the data in column percentage. It shows simply the percentages thanks to `stat = "identity"`.

-   I added labels for each bar to have an exact value written. I used the `geom_text(aes(label = percentage)`. And I chose labels position by trying out different values of `width`, `hjust` and `vjust` and this code is my consensus.

-   I added the title and other needed labels, e.g. names of axes.

-   I also chose a color palette which was magma for discrete values.

-   I chose the minimal theme.

-   Then I flipped the whole plot because I wanted it to resemble the plot I want to repair. And I had to choose the order of the labels in the legend and the bars on x axis.

-   This led to a problem that the legend was going the other way round than the bars displayed so I also had to reverse the order of list in the legend. And I had to choose the order of the bars on x axis.

-   Finally I needed to lengthen the y axis to let all the values be visible.

```{r}

my_repaired_plot <-ggplot(data = Table_votes_long, aes(x = factor(Voters_Group, levels = c("Independents", "Democrats", "Republicans", "All registered voters")), y = percentage, fill = factor(VoteCategory, ,levels = c("Strongly disapprove", "Somewhat disapprove", "Somewhat approve", "Strongly approve")))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = 'grey') +
  
  geom_text(aes(label = percentage), position = position_dodge(width = 1), hjust = -0.5) +
  labs(title = "Strength of Trump Approval/Disapproval by Party", 
       x = "Voters Group", 
       y = "Percent of the Votes in each party",
       fill = "Vote Options") +  
  
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip() +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = FALSE))+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma", breaks = c("Strongly approve", "Somewhat approve", "Somewhat disapprove", "Strongly disapprove")) +
  ylim(0, 90)
my_repaired_plot
```

Here I am saving my plot to an image.

```{r}

ggsave("images/my_repaired_plot.png", my_repaired_plot, width = 6, height = 4, scale = 1, bg = 'white')

```

## Outcome

This is the plot I created: ![goodplot](images/my_repaired_plot.png)
